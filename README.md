Opening Times
===

The theme for the main Opening Times website.
http://otdac.org/

Version: 2.0.1
Date: 14/11/17

Contains the main theme files responsible for presentation. All theme agnostic functionality like custom post-types and taxanomies are located in a separate plugin.

This version of the theme is intended to address perfomance in both the front and backend. Much of the code has been optimised and tidied and is now structured in a way to allow for quick implementation of any future additions or customisations.

This version can be used for production, but there are a few known, but edge case bugs realting to seaching and the 404 page.
