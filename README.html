<h1 id="openingtimes">Opening Times</h1>

<p>The theme for the main Opening Times website.
http://otdac.org/</p>

<p>Version: 2.0.0
Date: 14/11/17</p>

<p>Contains the main theme files responsible for presentation. All theme agnostic functionality like custom post-types and taxanomies are located in a separate plugin.</p>

<p>This version of the theme is intended to address perfomance in both the front and backend. Much of the code has been optimised and tidied and is now structured in a way to allow for quick implementation of any future additions or customisations.</p>

<p>This version can be used for production, but there are a few known, but edge case bugs realting to seaching and the 404 page.</p>
